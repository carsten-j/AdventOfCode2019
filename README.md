# Advent of Code_2019

This is the first year where I participate in Advent of Code. I am still in the process of learning Python. Hence my solutions are written in Python.

| Day  | Exercise | Note | 
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation  | Solution to exercise 2 can be simplified with expression assignment from Python 3.8 | 
| 2  | 1202 Program Alarm  | Deep copying a list is fast using slice notation |
